## Notes:

Can be found live on:

1.  Colors, Pixels Distances, and Fonts were done the best I could.
2.  I decided to make this a bit more fun and try to build all of this without a framework, and more/straigt Javascript (and Jquery for ease).
3.  In retrospect, this took way-way longer.  :(
4.  I did the same for not sure a CSS framework, like Bootrap.  This also took a ton longer.  Especially on the form.
5.  I did however, learn how to use SASS (as I have used LESS for the last 4+ years).  This was nice.  :)
6.  The cards scroll to the right.  I wasn't sure how to set up all five of them from the API call.  So I just made a simple scroll.
7.  I didn't make it responsive, because I ran out of steam.
8.  Same goes for making a fully funcational Nav Bar.
9.  All said and done, I think it represents the specs well.
10.  And of course, I always welcome any feedback, advice, critiques, etc...

Places of improvement:
1.  Refactor my CSS/SCSS.
2.  Write JS tests.
3.  Refactor JS.
4.  Maybe put API calls into localStorage or something like that.

Thank you, this was pretty fun!!

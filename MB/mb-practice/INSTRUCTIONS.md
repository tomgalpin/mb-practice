## Your challenge, should you choose to accept it
1. Clone this repo (or download the zip archive) to get started.
2. Your page should closely resemble [business_overview.png](business_overview.png) on the page load:
    
    <img src="business_overview.png" alt="alt text" width="250"/>
3. Your page should closely resemble [business_overview_expanded.png](business_overview_expanded.png) when the "more" links are clicked:
    
    <img src="business_overview_expanded.png" alt="alt text" width="250"/>
4. The pencil icon should change color on hover.
5. The "New Program" button should open a form to add a new program. This is where you get some UX/design freedom, but the form should have the following fields:
    - Program Type (single select)
        + Count Series
        + Time Series
        + Membership
    - Program Name (input)
    - Allow online scheduling (boolean)
    - Default capacity (input)
    - Tabs this program is on (multi-select)
        + Classes
        + Appointments
        + Workshops
        + Outside
        + Inside
        + Gym
6. You may use any front-end libraries you wish to complete the task. The Internet is your oyster!
7. Use the following API calls to populate any or all parts of page. The data returned may not reflect the amounts in the business_overview.png image.      Assume that the data from these calls is correct.
    - Programs (GET: https://api.myjson.com/bins/5bdb3)
    - Pricing Options (GET: https://api.myjson.com/bins/47axv)
8. When you're finished, send a link to your GitHub repo (preferred) or a .zip archive to your point-of-contact. (Make sure you include your unminified code!) If tooling is required (grunt, rails, yeoman, etc.), your submitted work should also be hosted so that it can viewed in a working state.

## What we're looking for
- **Attention to detail**. Can you build a near-identical representation of the screenshots we provided above? No detail is too small in our assessment.
- **Appropriate use of frameworks and tools**. You don't necessarily have to use the latest and greatest frameworks. As long as you use your preferred tools in an appropriate way and are able to describe your reasoning if asked, you're good to go.

## Bonus Points
You may choose to make the application repsonsive.

## Help!
Should you stumble into any questions during your quest, feel free tor reach out to your recruiter or dev contact. There are no stupid questions!
